ILM - I Love Movies -
======================

About ILM
----------

I have over 200 movies in all different formats on my hard drive. Knowing what movies I have already seen or would still like to watch is a problem. If I need more information about a movie I have to open my browser to look it up.
 
That is why I am creating ILM. ILM will be like an email client with each movie being one email. Think about all your movies as emails you have not read before. They will be shown in your "Inbox" you will also be able to tag them move them to other folder ect.
Basically all the features of a modern mail client applied to the concept of organising movies.

ILM will also look up information about a movie on the Internet and save the information to the same folder where the movie is located. If you are off-line the information is still there. When you add a new movie to your folder it will show up as newly copied. You
can also see what was newly added in the last day week month or year.

When someone needs to browse your collection to see what you have their is no need for them to preview each file in a media player they can just use ILM. If they like what they see they can add 
the movie to the copy list. Along with the movies and their related information files ILM will also be copied to the user so that they can add their own movies and keep going where you left of.

> Project is now on github

Usability 
-------------

Not much at the moment :( but I am working on it. Below is some GUI mock-ups of what I want in version 1.0

![You should see A mockup here](https://github.com/fredre/ILM/raw/master/ScreenShots/screen1.png "Planned for version 1")


Here is the full list of features planned for version 1.0 and what I have done so far

<features here>

Can I help 
-----------

Sure pick a feature and branch away. I am doing this because I need it I don't plan to make any money or become famous I just need a program that can fulfil my needs and maybe the needs of some others also.

More features 
-------------

If you have a great idea for a future on the list get in touch and implement it. Like I said I am doing this as a labour of love and nothing motivates a person
like someone showing interest in you project. Even if you just say hallo. I also over comment code and try to write things as simple as possible. I have only been coding with QT for about a month now so that expect any technical fireworks ;)

Technical
---------

ILM is written in C++ with the QT GUI library. I use QT creator for the IDE.
My development platform is Linux (But it should work on Windows and Mac also)
